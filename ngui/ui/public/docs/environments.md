The Shared Environments page organizes access to shared clusters or machines. On this page, you can:
- Book an environment for exclusive usage.
- View and plan its availability.
- Identify which version of the software is deployed.
- See which tickets are associated with the environments.
- Additionally, there is a Jira plugin to simplify and organize shared access to environments and to mark Jira tickets for which the environments are currently being used.
